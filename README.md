# Suki Tsubaki - Personal Website
Hello World! I'm Suki Tsubaki and this is my minimalist personal website.

This repository contains my personal website where I share my Haiku and Tanka poetry collections as well as information about my programming journey. The site features a clean, responsive design with subtle animations and seasonal poetry organized by traditional Japanese calendar divisions.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
- **Interactive Navigation**: Smooth transitions between different sections
- **Beautiful Typography**: Carefully selected fonts for readability and aesthetic appeal
- **Animations**: Subtle animations enhance the user experience without overwhelming visitors
- **Seasonal Poetry**: Collection of Haiku and Tanka organized by traditional Japanese seasons

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with CSS animations)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Intersection Observer API for scroll animations

## Poetry Collections

The website features two poetry collections:

1. **Haiku**: Traditional Japanese three-line poems with a 5-7-5 syllable pattern, organized by the 24 seasonal divisions of the traditional Japanese calendar.
2. **Tanka**: Five-line poems with a 5-7-5-7-7 syllable pattern, exploring deeper themes and emotions.
