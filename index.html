            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>
                Hello World! I'm Suki Tsubaki, a passionate hobby developer with an affinity for elegant solutions and minimalist design.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey began when I discovered the magic of coding as a child. Today I wield CSS, HTML, PHP, Python and TypoScript with experience, while leveling up my JavaScript, Lua, SQL, and Swift abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                I find joy in bringing small-scale projects to life, where creativity meets functionality. As a proud member of kawaii-kode ‚Äî a close-knit community of friends dedicated to creating applications with a personal touch ‚Äî I embrace collaborative learning while keeping things fun and light-hearted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond code, I compose Haiku and Tanka poetry, some of which I share on this site.
            </p>

        <section id="haiku">
            <h2>HAIKU</h2>
            <p>
                Haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry. These short poems consist of three lines with a 5-7-5 syllable pattern and often include references to nature and a seasonal element.
            </p>

        <section id="tanka">
            <h2>TANKA</h2>
            <p>
                Tanka is a classical form of Japanese poetry consisting of five lines with a 5-7-5-7-7 syllable pattern. This poetic form allows for deeper emotional expression than Haiku.
