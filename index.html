                        Hello World! I'm Suki Tsubaki, a passionate hobby developer with an affinity for elegant solutions and minimalist design. My journey began when I discovered the magic of coding as a child, tinkering with simple programs that sparked a lifelong fascination with technology. Today I wield CSS, HTML, PHP, Python and TypoScript with experience, while leveling up my JavaScript, Lua, SQL and Swift abilities. Each language has become another brushstroke in my creative palette, allowing me to tackle diverse challenges with confidence and curiosity.

                        I find joy in bringing small-scale projects to life, where creativity meets functionality. These digital creations may not change the world, but they solve real problems and add meaningful moments of delight to everyday experiences. As a proud member of kawaii-kode — a close-knit community of friends dedicated to creating applications with a personal touch — I embrace collaborative learning while keeping things fun and light-hearted. Our shared belief is that the best code emerges from supportive environments where experimentation is encouraged and failures are celebrated as stepping stones.

            <p>
                Beyond code, I compose Haiku and Tanka poetry, some of which I share on this site. These ancient Japanese forms provide a beautiful counterbalance to the structured logic of programming, allowing me to express emotions and observations in concise, evocative ways. The discipline of finding beauty in brevity influences both my poetry and my coding style – whether I'm crafting verses or functions, I strive for elegance, clarity and meaning in the fewest possible lines. When not immersed in code or poetry, you'll find me exploring nature trails, practicing brush calligraphy, or losing myself in science fiction novels.

    <h2>HAIKU</h2>
    <p>
        Haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry. These short poems consist of three lines with a 5-7-5 syllable pattern and often include references to nature and a seasonal element.

            <h2>TANKA</h2>
            <p>
                Tanka is a classical form of Japanese poetry consisting of five lines with a 5-7-5-7-7 syllable pattern. This poetic form allows for deeper emotional expression than Haiku.
